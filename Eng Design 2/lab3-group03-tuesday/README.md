## From RF Data to Mono Audio

The main objective of this 3DY4 lab is to understand how to use signal-ï¬‚ow graphs to model a real-life radio application in software. The particular case study concerns processing RF data from an FM channel to produce mono audio. All the details are in the lab [document](doc/3dy4-lab3.pdf).

The start-up code is in the [model](model/) and [src](src/) sub-folders. The in-lab experiments and the take-home exercises are due one week plus one extra day after you have started the in-lab experiments. For example, the Tuesday groups who start the lab on Tuesday, January 30, at 2:30 p.m. have this lab due before Wednesday, February 7, at 2:30 p.m.; the same principle applies to Wednesday and Thursday groups.
